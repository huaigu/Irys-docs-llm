# Irys Documentation for AI Coding Assistants

[中文](./README.zh-cn.md)

## What is this?

This repository downloads the complete official documentation for Irys and processes it into context files specifically for use with AI coding assistants, such as "vibe coder".

The primary goal is to provide AI tools with a comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge base of the Irys SDK and its functionalities.

## Generated Files

This process generates two main files:

- **`LLM_Full.txt`**: Contains the complete, concatenated documentation. This is ideal for providing the AI with maximum context.
- **`LLM_Simple.txt`**: A more concise, summarized version of the documentation, suitable for quick reference or when token limits are a concern.

## Usage

To use this, you can copy the content of either `LLM_Simple.txt` or `LLM_Full.txt` and provide it as context to your AI coding assistant. This will enable it to generate more accurate and context-aware code for Irys-related development tasks.
