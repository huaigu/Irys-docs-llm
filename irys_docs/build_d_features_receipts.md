      {
        "title": "Receipts & Timestamps",
        "content": "When you upload data to Irys, it is stamped with a millisecond-accurate timestamp before being stored onchain. Blockchains rely on timestamps to sequence the order of transactions and blocks. Transaction sequencing plays a critical role in blockchain security as it ensures that all transactions are recorded in the correct order, and that order is never changed. Receipts provide cryptographic proof of a timestamp."

        "content": "Ordering and streaming applications process and deliver data in real-time. They're commonly used for messaging, event processing, and data integration. They transfer high data volumes between independent applications while maintaining high performance and scalability. Popular examples include Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ."

        "title": "Why Use Signed Receipts?",
        "content": "Cryptographically signed receipts open up new development options for builders. For example: 1. Sequential ordering of posts, likes and comments for a decentralized social protocol. 2. Sequential ordering of data generated by a group messaging protocol. 3. Automatically adjudicating music copyright claims. 4. Preserving history, ensuring it's not manipulated over time. 5. Preserving scientific research using Irys's pay-once, store-forever model."

        "title": "Receipt Permanence",
        "content": "Upon posting a transaction to Irys, a receipt is immediately returned to the user. Irys maintains an internal registry of all receipts, which can be queried whenever a receipt is needed. These receipts are stored in a centralized fashion, which may be sufficient for users comfortable with the trust assumptions of centralized services. You can also opt to permanently store your receipt on Irys by uploading it using our SDK or CLI."

        "title": "Verifying Receipts",
        "content": "You may need to verify a receipt at some point after it was issued. For example, if your applicationâ€™s security depends on the order of transactions, you can then verify every receipt to ensure its order has not been tampered with. The receipt contains a signature field, which is generated by creating a deep hash of information from the receipt, including transaction ID and timestamp. The receipt is then signed it by Irys. Using the Irys SDK you can verify the signature using the same values from the receipt along with the supplied public key."
