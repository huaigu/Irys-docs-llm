  "description": "A Note From Our Founder: \n\n\"Hirys, and welcome to our alpha testnet— you're dangerously early.\"\n\nIf you're wondering who we are, let me fill you in. We're Irys, the world's first programmable datachain.\n\n**Datachain** means we're an L1 that incentivizes storage.\n\n**Programmable** means that data on Irys is composable. On Irys, smart contracts will be able to natively **access** (read), **manipulate** (validate, reference, or evolve), and **write** back to the storage layer (output)—all within a single protocol.\n\nOur alpha testnet is live as of September 2nd, 2024, starting with support for permanent data uploads. Over the coming weeks, we'll be rolling out the IrysVM, temporary data, and programmable data.",
